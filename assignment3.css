/* ====== Global Styling ====== */
/* I reset the body to remove default margins and paddings to have better control over the layout. 
   I chose Arial as the font for its clean, modern look. The background color (#f3f4f6) is a light, 
   neutral shade to provide contrast against the container. I used flexbox to center the container 
   both horizontally and vertically, ensuring the content is visually balanced. */
   body {
    margin: 0;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f3f4f6;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 0;
    height: 100vh; /* This makes the body take up the full height of the viewport. */
    display: flex; /* Flexbox helps align the container easily. */
    justify-content: center; /* Centers the container horizontally. */
    align-items: center; /* Centers the container vertically. */
}

/* ====== Container for Styling ====== */
/* I created this container to hold all the content. I used a white background to make 
   it stand out against the light gray body background. Rounded corners (10px) and a subtle shadow 
   (box-shadow) were added to give the container a modern, professional look. I increased the padding 
   for better spacing and set a max-width to ensure the container stays readable on larger screens. */
.container {
    background-color: #ffffff;
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 40px; /* Increased padding for a spacious feel. */
    box-shadow: 0 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Stronger shadow for emphasis. */
    width: 80%; /* Makes the container responsive on smaller screens. */
    max-width: 800px; /* Prevents the container from becoming too wide on large screens. */
    text-align: center;
}

/* ====== Weather Image Row ======  */
/* I used flexbox again to align the weather images in a horizontal row. Adding 
   'justify-content: space-between' ensures even spacing between the images for a clean layout. 
   The margin at the bottom creates separation from the rest of the content. */
.image-row {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between; /* Distributes the images evenly across the row. */
    margin-bottom: 20px; /* Adds spacing below the images. */
}

/* ======  Weather Icons ======  */
/* To ensure the icons look consistent, I set their width to 100px and used 'height: auto' to 
   maintain their original aspect ratio. This keeps the images sharp and proportional. */
.weather-icon {
    width: 100px; /* Larger size for better visibility. */
    height: auto;
}

/* ======  Heading Style ======  */
/* I chose a darker text color (#333333) for good readability against the white background. 
   The larger font size (32px) helps the heading stand out as the main title of the page. */
h1 {
    color: #333333;
    font-size: 32px; /* Larger size to draw attention. */
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}

/* ======  Button Style ======  */
/* The button is styled with a green background (#28a745) to indicate a call-to-action. 
   I used a larger font size and padding to make it easier to click, especially on mobile devices. 
   The hover effect provides feedback to the user when interacting with the button. */
button {
    background-color: #28a745; /* Green is a friendly, action-oriented color. */
    color: white;
    font-size: 18px; /* Increased size for readability. */
    padding: 15px 30px; /* Larger button for better usability. */
    border: none; /* Removes the default border for a clean look. */
    border-radius: 5px; /* Rounded corners for a modern design. */
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease; /* Smooth hover effect for better UX. */
}

button:hover {
    background-color: #218838; /* Slightly darker green to indicate interaction. */
}

/* ======  Output Style ======  */
/* I increased the font size (20px) for better readability and used the same text color 
   (#333333) to keep the design consistent with the heading. */

    font-size: 20px;
